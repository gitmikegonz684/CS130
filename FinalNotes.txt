Permissions and admin on files
- "777" = system mask when using <chmod>
- "000" = removing all permissions when using <chmod>

Output on the command line
- using quotes [' '] will print out whatever is inside if you use the <echo> command
- quoting is a BIG DEAL because it delays the interpretation of arguments.

For Lab #5
- look in [/home/kloos/bin] and use the [args] file in the CS Lab.
- $0 is the variable for the name of the program... the 0th argument when you run the script.

For Lab #4
- Don't have to use loops for the "challenge" in #5
	- "16 times the previous spot"
	- should be able to handle any number of strings

Expressions from Class Notebook
- just know that this was the only way at one point.
- it has gotten much easier now, the way described in the notes is too complicated.

Linux OS Process
- a process is a program in execution
- before being executed it was in the harddrive
- use the [ps] command to see the currently running processes
- it's up to the scheduler to pick a process out of the "ready queue"
	- you don't know the order in which te processes will be executed. The OS decieds.
- the "counter" file in Class Notebook (pg.77) demonstrates processes.
	- the sleep process' only purpose is to count to 3 then die
	- after it does this it lets the counter know

The grep Command
- using quotes in combination with grep  removes the meaning of meta characters
- quotes also delay the interpretation of w/e is in the quotes.
	- EX:$ grep '\.$' big
		- looks for all lines in file "big" that end with a period.
	- EX:$ grep 'th.*q' big | grep unset
		- looks for lines in file "big" that contain "th" then "q" then "unset" (???) 

Block Devices/ Char Devices
- found inside dev/null

The find Command (pg.81)
- searches for files and executes actions on the found files
	- EX:$ find $1 -type f -exec grep -il "$2" {} \; -exec grep -in "$2" {} \;
		- search file in specified dirs ($1) for passed search string ($2) first grep list file name; second grep displays #ed found lines.

The sed Command (pg.82)
- stands for "stream editor"
- it replaces multiple strings in multiple files with a single command. 
- can also be used to just make one change in one file.

The FINAL EXAM
- 70/30 ratio emphasis on newer stuff from "Pipes" to now.
- multiple choice, T/F, written
- contrast static vs dynamic in OS 
	- yeah dynamic is loading files....
- what is a shell?
- he is assuming we have tried examples in Class Notes
- no tar and zip
- xargs is fair game because we did a program on it
- know labs 3, 4, 5
	- might pull questions from lab 5
- LARGE SCANTRON
- 45% grade = final exam
- how to study for this:
	- class notes, labs

For Lab 5
- highlight my written code
- have big lines between problem #s
- print out and bring in for final
