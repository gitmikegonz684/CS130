MIDTERM REVIEW

- know RELATIVE vs ABSOLUTE
- ASCII uses 7 of the 8 bits. 8 bits = 256
- word count command = wc ; displays lines, words, chars
- octal dump command = od ; displays octal base aid
- in ASCII, 10, is a newline character
- know how to convert from ASCII to DECIMAL so you can use ASCII table on hex codes
- hex dump command = hd ; similar to octal dump only the output is in order and at the end of the line it displays the actual text in the file.
- study "Interacting with Other Users" p.36(?) from class textbook. Will be helpful for LAB#2
- problem 3D should say $2 instead of $1
