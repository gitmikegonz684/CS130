MIDTERM REVIEW

- know RELATIVE vs ABSOLUTE
- ASCII uses 7 of the 8 bits. 8 bits = 256
- word count command = wc ; displays lines, words, chars
- octal dump command = od ; displays octal base aid
- in ASCII, 10, is a newline character
- know how to convert from ASCII to DECIMAL so you can use ASCII table on hex codes
- hex dump command = hd ; similar to octal dump only the output is in order and at the end of the line it displays the actual text in the file.
- study "Interacting with Other Users" p.36(?) from class textbook. Will be helpful for LAB#2
- problem 3D should say $2 instead of $1

- "Stream of data" = linear array of bytes.
- "cal > out" = will write the CAL ouput to a file called OUT
- p. 37 -- "stdin" = 0 ; "stdout" = 1 ; "stderr" = 2
- "who" = displays who is logged in at the moment
- "file *" will list a description of the file types in the current directory
- p.38 -- "tr abcdef 123456 < mydoc > newdoc" ; KNOW/UNDERSTAND THIS.
- "ls -d n*" will show you files that start with N only in the current directory (because of the -d)
- ">" and ">>" are two different METACHARACTERS. The second one "appends" to the file listed afterwards "cal asdf 2>> bad"
- "cat foo" vs "cat < foo" = same output but different process. "cat foo" has to go out and get FOO and then open it and then spit it back out. "cat < foo" opens then file and takes the contents and then gives THAT to CAT.
- (p.38) KNOW the "tr" command.
- "CTRL d" will nicely stop a process.
- "CTRL c" will throw a grenade and kill the process with fire.
- (p.39-40) goes over CTRL d make sure you know that too.
- (p.41) dev null thing at the top and PIPE at the bottom. Study these as well.
